NAME
    Parallel::Scoreboard - a scoreboard for monitoring status of many
    processes

SYNOPSIS
      use Parallel::Scoreboard;

      my $scoreboard = Parallel::Scoreboard->new(
          base_dir => '/tmp/my_scoreboard'
      ...

      # in each worker process
      $scoreboard->update('this is my current status');

      # to read status of all worker processes
      my $stats = $scoreboard->read_all();
      for my $pid (sort { $a <=> $b } keys %$stats) {
          print "status for pid:$pid is: ", $stats->{$pid}, "\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Parallel::Scoreboard is a pure-perl implementation of a process
    scoreboard. By using the module it is easy to create a monitor for many
    worker process, like the status module of the Apache HTTP server.

    Unlike other similar modules, Parallel::Scoreboard is easy to use and
    has no limitation on the format or the length of the statuses to be
    stored. Any arbitrary data (like JSON or frozen perl object) can be
    saved by the worker processes as their status and read from the manager
    process.

METHODS
  new(base_dir => $base_dir)
    instantiation. Receives the directory name in which the scoreboard files
    will be stored. The directory will be created if it does not exist
    already.

  update($status)
    saves the status of the process

  read_all()
    reads the status of all worker processes that are alive and that have
    called update() more than once. Returned value is a hashref with process
    ids as keys and the statuses of each processes as corresponding values.

  cleanup()
    remove obsolete status files found in base_dir. The files are normally
    removed upon the termination of worker process, however they might be
    left unremoved if the worker process was killed for some reason. The
    detection and removal of the obsolete status files is performed by
    read_all() as well.

  id()
    The id this scoreboard will use when storing its status. By default,
    uses $$.

    Subclasses may override this to use identifiers other than pids.

  filename_to_id()
    Given a filename, return an id if it contains one. By default, looks for
    "/status_(\d+)$".

    If you override "id" to return something other than an integer, you'll
    need to override this too.
